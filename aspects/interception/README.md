# Interception Tools

> Configures the [Interception Tools](https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/tools) on Linux (analogous to Karabiner-Elements on macOS).

- Uses the [Dual Function Keys](https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/dual-function-keys) plug-in to map Enter to Control (when chorded with another key) or Enter (when tapped).
- Uses [the custom `mac2linux` plug-in](support/mac2linux.c) to perform a number of Colemak-specific overrides that enable:
  - The use of many macOS-style keyboard shortcuts on Linux (for things like Copy, Cut, Paste etc).
  - The use of several macOS-style "dead key" combinations on Linux (for typing things like "ñ", "ü" etc).
