# This file hacks together macOS-like dead-key support for characters commonly
# typed in Spanish, plus some handy others:
#
# - Á, É, Í, Ó, Ú, Ü, Ñ, — (EM DASH), €
# - á, é, í, ó, ú, ü, ñ
#
# You might think that something like the following could be used but, sadly, X
# ignores the `Meta` modifier here and simply treats _all_ presses of the `n`
# key as dead-key presses, which means that you can't type a naked `n` any more.
#
#     !Meta <n> <space>  : "~" U007E # TILDE
#     !Meta <n> <N>      : "Ñ" U00D1 # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH TILDE
#     !Meta <n> <n>      : "ñ" U00F1 # LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH TILDE
#
# There is evidence that others have seen the same behavior:
#
#     https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/207067/modifier-keys-in-compose-sequence
#
# This page suggest that this omission may be intentional, even though the
# modifiers are documented in the man page:
#
# > Some keysyms, such as keysyms for modifier keys, are ignored - they have no
# > effect on the status or otherwise.
#
#     https://xkbcommon.org/doc/current/group__compose.html
#
# You might then think about making this work by defining every other possible
# combination of keypresses so that `n` can come out as long as not followed by
# an `n`.
#
#     <n> <a> : "na"
#     <n> <b> : "nb"
#     etc...
#
# Even if that worked (it doesn't, because then you can't type `nn`), you're
# still left with the problem that things that require an immediate response
# (like `n` in Vim) don't work any more.

# Ideally, we'd be able to use Interception Tools to map as follows:
#
# - Left-Meta-n to <dead_tilde>
# - Left-Meta-e to <dead_acute>
# - Left-Meta-u to <dead_diaeresis>
#
# and then use those "dead" keysyms in here to do what we want.
#
# But we have a mismatch between the above (defined in
# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h), and the the kernel-level keycodes
# defined in /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h, which don't have
# any of the X-specific stuff. There is substantial overlap with
# /usr/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h, but that doesn't help us much
# here.
#
# So here is where we finally end up: we use Interception Tools to map to
# function keys instead. The final fly in the ointment is that even though the
# right keycodes are being sent (and `evtest` confirms this), XCompose (and
# also `xev`) aren't seeing those function keys, unless we override them in our
# `~/.Xmodmap` and call it from our `~/.xinitrc`.

# Ideally, we'd have a bunch of other dead-key equivalents to what we have on

# too much. For now, starting with the basics that I need to be able to write
# Spanish.
