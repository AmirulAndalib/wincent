# Note that my external keyboard has a dip switch in it so that it works
# properly with the Mac:
#
# - On a Mac keyboard modifiers on left are: Control / Alt / Command (Super)
# - On a Windows keyboard modifiers are: Control / Windows (Super) / Alt
# - When plugged into my Mac, the middle modifier behaves as Alt.
# - When plugged into Linux, the middle modifier feels to me like "Alt"
#   (due to muscle memory), but it looks to the system like "Super".
#
# In other words, "Alt" here means "Command (Super)", not actual "Alt".
