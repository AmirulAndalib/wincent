[pager]
# commands which should use a pager

# default is:
#   annotate, cat, diff, export, grep, heads, help, incoming, locate, log, outgoing, parents, sl, smartlog, status, tags, tip
# we add:
#   man
#   shelve
#   show (also affects `ex`; oddly, adding `ex` does not affect `show`)
#   whatchanged
attend = annotate, cat, diff, export, grep, heads, help, incoming, locate, log, outgoing, parents, shelve, sl, smartlog, status, tags, tip, man, show, whatchanged

[alias]
# garbage collect commits that aren't reachable from bookmarks
cleanup = strip -r "all() - ::bookmark()"

# muscle memory
show = ex
clean = purge

# braindeadness
man = help

whatchanged = log --stat -f
